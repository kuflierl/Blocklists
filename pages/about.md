Finding a good collection of up to date and effective Blocklists has always been a significant issue when using blocking tools like [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net) and [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com). There are a lot of big and small blacklists on the internet that all lack to some extent. The intent of this project is to generate and distribute up to date composite blacklists using the tools [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make), Github Actions and Github Pages.
